# Circle Survivors (working title)
Prototype of single player game made with Unity.

## Idea
Control a group of characters, each individually targeting and attacking enemies in range. The characters form a circle of defense that can be turned in order to match the group against approaching enemies.

## Git Repository
The project is versioned using Unity Version Control (previously Plastic SCM). Demo snapshots are versioned using git and pushed to GitHub.
